# ELIZA Chatbot - A Conversational AI in Python

## Overview

The ELIZA Chatbot is a Python implementation of a text-based conversational AI inspired by the historic ELIZA program, developed to provide users with an engaging and responsive chatbot experience. This chatbot takes user input and provides predefined responses, offering users a sense of meaningful interaction while incorporating modern features such as sentiment analysis, feedback collection, and conversation history recording.

## Key Features:

- Pattern-based responses to user input, creating an illusion of natural conversation.
- Sentiment analysis to gauge the user's emotional state.
- Date and time retrieval to provide additional utility.
- User feedback collection to enhance the chatbot's performance.
- Detailed conversation history recording for analysis and optimization.

## Usage

- **Conversing with ELIZA:** Simply start the chat by typing your messages. ELIZA will respond based on predefined patterns and can engage in meaningful conversations.

- **Obtaining Date and Time:** Typing "date and time" will prompt ELIZA to provide the current date and time.

- **Providing Feedback:** After ending a conversation with "bye," users can provide feedback when prompted. Feedback is invaluable for continuous improvement.

- **Accessing Conversation History:** ELIZA stores your conversation history for future reference. You can review past interactions, as well as access feedback provided.

## Installation

- **Python:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This code is compatible with Python 3.

- **Dependencies:** This project relies on external Python libraries for certain functionalities. Install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install textblob
```
